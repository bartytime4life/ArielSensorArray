# 🛰️ SpectraMind V50 — DataLoader Persistent Workers (TEST/INFERENCE)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   • Control worker persistence during test/inference runs.
#   • Inference is often one-shot; persistent workers rarely help.
#
# When to Use
#   • 🚫 Typically false, since test loaders run only once.
#   • ✅ May set true if inference spans many batches (e.g. large ensembles).
# ==============================================================================

persistent_workers: false

notes: |
  Test loaders:
  • Persistent workers disabled by default (single-pass inference).
  • Keeps inference deterministic and lightweight.
  • Enable only if running long batched inference jobs.
