# 🛰️ SpectraMind V50 — DataLoader Persistent Workers (TRAIN)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   • Control whether DataLoader worker processes persist across training epochs.
#   • Helps avoid process re-spawn overhead and improves throughput.
#
# When to Use
#   • ✅ Long multi-epoch training on GPU → set to true for speed.
#   • ⚠️ If workers may leak memory or hang, set to false for safety.
# ==============================================================================

persistent_workers: true

notes: |
  Training loaders:
  • Persistent workers enabled for faster per-epoch startup.
  • Recommended for Kaggle/HPC runs where DataLoader overhead matters.
  • Disable only in debugging/CI where worker churn is safer.
