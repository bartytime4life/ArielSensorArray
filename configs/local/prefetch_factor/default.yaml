# ==============================================================================
# ðŸ“¦ Prefetch Factor â€” Default (Balanced Mode)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   â€¢ Balanced prefetching for most local development and Kaggle leaderboard runs.
#   â€¢ Keeps GPU utilization high without stressing memory.
#   â€¢ Serves as the safe "general-purpose" profile for training and validation.
# ==============================================================================

prefetch_factor: 2              # each worker preloads 2 batches ahead of time
persistent_workers: true        # keep workers alive across epochs for efficiency

notes: |
  Default (Balanced) mode:
  â€¢ Each DataLoader worker preloads 2 batches, reducing GPU idle time.
  â€¢ Provides a safe trade-off between memory footprint and throughput.
  â€¢ Persistent workers remain alive across epochs â†’ faster epoch restarts.
  â€¢ Optimized for Kaggle (~â‰¤9h runtime) and local GPU dev boxes.
  â€¢ Recommended baseline setting: stable on T4/A10/L4 GPUs and CPUs.
  â€¢ For extreme low-memory debugging â†’ use `local/prefetch_factor=debug`.
  â€¢ For maximum throughput on HPC/SSD nodes â†’ use `local/prefetch_factor=fast`
    (4) or `local/prefetch_factor=heavy` (8).
