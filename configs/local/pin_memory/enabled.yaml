# üìå Pin Memory ‚Äî Enabled
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   ‚Ä¢ Enable page-locked (pinned) host memory in DataLoader.
#   ‚Ä¢ Accelerates host‚ÜíGPU transfers by avoiding OS paging overhead.
#   ‚Ä¢ Standard best practice for CUDA training/inference with DataLoader.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When to Use
#   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ GPU training/inference (especially with large batches).
#   ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Kaggle / HPC runs where throughput matters.
#   ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Ignored on CPU-only runs (no benefit).

pin_memory: true
persistent_workers: true     # usually paired with pin_memory for throughput

notes: |
  Pin memory enabled:
  ‚Ä¢ Host memory is page-locked ‚Üí DMA transfers to GPU are faster.
  ‚Ä¢ Recommended default for most Kaggle/HPC GPU runs (T4, A10, L4, A100).
  ‚Ä¢ Slightly higher host RAM usage; disable in tight-memory or debug contexts.
  ‚Ä¢ Combine with `prefetch_factor=2` or `fast`/`heavy` profiles for maximum GPU utilization.
  ‚Ä¢ Safe to leave enabled: has no effect on CPU-only jobs.
  ‚Ä¢ For mission-grade reproducibility, always log whether pin_memory was enabled in
    v50_debug_log.md along with config hash.
