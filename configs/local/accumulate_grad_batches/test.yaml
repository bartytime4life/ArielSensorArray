# 🛰️ SpectraMind V50 — Gradient Accumulation (TEST/INFERENCE)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   • Test/inference phase does not use backward passes.
#   • Accumulation setting has no effect but preserved for Hydra consistency.
#
# When to Use
#   • 🚫 Always 1 — no gradients in inference.
#   • ✅ Included to keep interface uniform across all phases.
# ==============================================================================

accumulate_grad_batches: 1

notes: |
  Test/inference loaders:
  • No backprop → accumulation unused.
  • Kept for reproducibility and Hydra group symmetry.
  • Avoid confusion: effective batch size = eval_batch_size, not controlled here.
