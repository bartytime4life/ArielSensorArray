# 🛰️ SpectraMind V50 — Gradient Accumulation (VALIDATION)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   • Validation doesn’t update weights; accumulation has no effect on optimizer.
#   • Kept here for config completeness and symmetry with train/test.
#
# When to Use
#   • 🚫 Typically always 1 (no accumulation).
#   • ✅ You may set >1 for consistency/testing, but it has no training impact.
# ==============================================================================

accumulate_grad_batches: 1

notes: |
  Validation loaders:
  • No gradient updates → accumulation irrelevant.
  • Always keep =1 unless debugging pipeline consistency.
  • Included for Hydra symmetry: keeps val/test aligned with train knobs.
