# ðŸ“‚ configs/data/.gitkeep
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   This file ensures the configs/data/ directory is preserved in Git
#   even if no dataset-specific YAML configs are present yet.
#
#   In SpectraMind V50, all dataset definitions live here, e.g.:
#     â€¢ nominal.yaml â€” ESA Ariel nominal dataset (FGS1 + AIRS)
#     â€¢ toy.yaml     â€” tiny synthetic dataset for CI smoke/dev
#     â€¢ custom.yaml  â€” user-extended datasets
#
# Integration:
#   â€¢ Hydra: configs in this folder are composed by train.yaml and
#     calibrate.yaml via Hydraâ€™s defaults list.
#   â€¢ CLI: selected with commands like:
#         spectramind train data=nominal
#         spectramind train data=toy trainer=ci_fast
#   â€¢ DVC: each data config maps to a DVC stage (calibration, split).
#   â€¢ Kaggle: configs include kaggle_safe toggles for â‰¤9 hr runtime.
#
# Why Keep This File:
#   Git will not track empty directories. By convention, we include a
#   .gitkeep with documentation so this folder remains in version
#   control until populated with YAML configs. This also signals to
#   collaborators and CI/CD that data configs are an expected part of
#   the repository structure.
#
# Notes:
#   â€¢ Never delete this file unless configs/data/ contains at least one
#     YAML config and repo policy no longer requires .gitkeep.
#   â€¢ Treated as documentation â€” safe to ignore in Hydra composition.
#   â€¢ Maintains mission-grade reproducibility: every run must pin its
#     data config (even toy/CI runs).
