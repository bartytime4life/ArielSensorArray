.dvc/.dvcignore — SpectraMind V50 Documentation

Purpose

This file defines ignore rules specific to DVC (Data Version Control).
It prevents DVC from accidentally trying to version-control ephemeral files, logs, caches, environment metadata, or IDE/editor cruft.

🔑 Difference from .gitignore
	•	.gitignore: Tells Git what not to track.
	•	.dvcignore: Tells DVC what not to track inside DVC-managed directories (data/, outputs/, models/, etc.).

By combining both, SpectraMind V50 ensures:
	•	Reproducibility: Only intentional pipeline artifacts are tracked in DVC.
	•	Portability: Kaggle/CI pipelines run cleanly, without accidental junk in DVC DAGs.
	•	Auditability: Every tracked file is meaningful (data, models, calibration outputs), nothing transient.

Categories of Ignored Files

🐍 Python Build Artifacts

These are autogenerated by the Python runtime or packaging tools.
They should never be tracked by DVC — they add noise, are platform-specific, and are regenerated on demand.

**/__pycache__/
**/*.pyc
**/*.pyo
**/*.pyd
**/*.so
**/*.dll
**/*.dylib
**/*.egg-info/
*.egg
dist/
build/

📓 Notebook / Editor Junk

Notebook checkpoints, editor temp files, and autosave artifacts.
These clutter DVC directories and are already managed by Git history if needed.

**/.ipynb_checkpoints/
**/*.swp
**/*.swo
**/*.tmp
**/*.bak


⸻

📊 Logs & Run Artifacts

Logs, experiment traces, and temp run data.
These belong in logs/ (tracked optionally by Git, not DVC).
Only structured outputs (CSV/JSON summaries) should enter DVC.

logs/**
wandb/**
mlruns/**
tensorboard/**
.dvc/tmp/**
.dvc/exp/**


⸻

🌍 Environment & Dependency Files

Local environments differ per developer, machine, or Kaggle runner.
We ignore them in DVC so dependencies are pinned in Git (via pyproject.toml, poetry.lock, requirements.txt) instead.

.venv/**
.env
.env.*
.conda_env/
Pipfile
Pipfile.lock
poetry.lock
pyproject.toml
requirements*.txt

🏆 Kaggle / Competition Artifacts

Ephemeral Kaggle run dirs, submission zips, and caches.
DVC should never track these — they are reproducible via pipeline stages (spectramind submit).

kaggle_work/**
kaggle_notebooks/**
kaggle_submissions/**
kaggle_cache/**


⸻

🖥️ OS / IDE Noise

Local dev files, editor settings, and system artifacts.
Not relevant to DVC or Git reproducibility.

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.idea/**
.vscode/**
*.log

✅ What Should Be Tracked in DVC?
	•	data/ — raw telescope data, processed calibration data (snapshotted, versioned).
	•	outputs/ — model outputs, diagnostics, predictions.
	•	models/ — serialized models (.pth, .pt, .ckpt).
	•	artifacts/ — submission bundles, packaged experiment artifacts.

Everything else is ignored by default.

Alignment with V50 Philosophy
	•	Glass-Box Reproducibility ￼: Only scientifically meaningful artifacts enter DVC; all junk stays ignored.
	•	CLI-First Workflows ￼: spectramind train, spectramind diagnose, etc. always produce outputs that map cleanly to DVC.
	•	CI/Kaggle Safety ￼: Pipelines won’t break due to stray cache files being picked up by DVC.
	•	NASA-Grade Documentation: This README ensures every ignore rule is justified, auditable, and future-proof.

⸻

🚀 Usage Notes
	•	.dvcignore lives at /.dvc/.dvcignore.
	•	When you run dvc add, dvc repro, or dvc exp run, these rules tell DVC what to skip.
	•	To add new ignores, document why they exist here before committing.
	•	To check what DVC sees (post-ignore):

dvc ls .

Final Safety Rails
	1.	Never ignore actual data/models (data/, outputs/, models/, artifacts/) unless you mean to exclude entire subtrees of junk.
	2.	Never track logs or environments in DVC. They belong in Git (if text) or should be regenerated.
	3.	Audit .dvcignore alongside .gitignore every quarter to ensure alignment with evolving pipeline needs.
