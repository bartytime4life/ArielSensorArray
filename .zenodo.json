“description”: “SpectraMind V50 is a mission-grade, CLI-first, neuro-symbolic, physics-informed AI pipeline for the NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge. It integrates a long-sequence Structured State-Space Model (SSM) for FGS1 time-series with a molecule- and wavelength-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) for AIRS spectra. Training uses Gaussian log-likelihood with symbolic/physics constraints (smoothness, non-negativity, molecular coherence, photonic alignment).Reproducibility is enforced via Hydra configs, DVC/lakeFS data versioning, CI workflows, and Docker/Poetry environments, with deterministic self-tests. Outputs include per-wavelength μ and σ, plus diagnostics (UMAP/t-SNE, SHAP, symbolic overlays, FFT, calibration maps) and leaderboard-ready Kaggle submissions. All functionality is orchestrated through a unified Typer CLI with integrated logging, symbolic validation, and diagnostics dashboards.”,
