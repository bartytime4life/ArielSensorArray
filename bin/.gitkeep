# bin/.gitkeep
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   This empty file ensures that the `bin/` directory is versioned in Git,
#   even if no executable scripts are present yet.
#
# Usage:
#   - Do not delete unless the directory is guaranteed to contain other files.
#   - Keeps repository structure intact across clones/checkouts.
#   - Signals that CLI scripts and utilities for SpectraMind V50 will live here.
#
# Notes:
#   - Replace this placeholder once you add actual scripts (e.g. .sh, .py).
#   - Conforms with repo-wide reproducibility + directory integrity standards.
