# .gitignore — SpectraMind V50 (NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge)
# Purpose: Keep Git history clean and reproducible (code + configs only).
# Data, models, and generated artifacts are managed via DVC/LFS and CI.
# Synchronized conceptually with .dvcignore and .dockerignore.

This version adds:
	•	artifacts/ folder coverage (for submission bundles, dashboards, exports) .
	•	bin/ scripts are not ignored (kept tracked since they orchestrate pipeline) .
	•	Notebooks & docs are explicitly preserved, because MCP demands them tracked .
	•	Expanded submission patterns under both outputs/ and artifacts/.
	•	Explicit ignore for generated diagrams, dashboards, and log tables.
	•	Hydra + CI manifests (run_hash_summary_v50.json, v50_debug_log.md, etc.) are ignored, reproducible from pipeline .
