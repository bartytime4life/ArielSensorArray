# ==============================================================================
# .gitignore — SpectraMind V50 (NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge)
# Purpose: Keep Git history clean and reproducible (code + configs only).
# Data, models, and generated artifacts are managed via DVC/lakeFS and CI.
# Synchronized conceptually with .dvcignore and .dockerignore.
