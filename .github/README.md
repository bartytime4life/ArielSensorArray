# 🌌 SpectraMind V50 — GitHub Meta & Governance

This `.github/` directory contains all **project governance, automation, and contribution infrastructure**  
for the **SpectraMind V50** repository, built for the **NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge**.

The design philosophy is aligned with **NASA-grade reproducibility**, **CLI-first workflows**, and  
**scientific rigor** [oai_citation:0‡SpectraMind V50 Technical Plan for the NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge.pdf](file-service://file-6PdU5f5knreHjmSdSauj3w) [oai_citation:1‡SpectraMind V50 Project Analysis (NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge).pdf](file-service://file-QRDy8Xn69XgxEjZgtZZ8FK). Every template, workflow, and policy enforces  
**traceability from CLI command → Hydra config → run hash → CI validation**.

📝 Issue Templates

All issues must be filed using structured YAML forms under .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.
This ensures:
	•	Bug Reports: CLI command, config hash, logs, repro steps.
	•	Feature Requests: Motivation, proposed CLI/config solution, impact.
	•	Docs Requests: File/section, missing content, proposed edits.
	•	Performance Issues: Metrics snapshot, expected vs actual, environment.
	•	Security Reports: Coordinated disclosure, redacted evidence, mitigations.
	•	Config Updates: Hydra/DVC/CI config paths, YAML diffs, validation plan.
	•	Task Tracking: DoR/DoD, subtasks, acceptance criteria, CLI repro.

➡️ See ISSUE_TEMPLATE/architecture.md for the full rationale.

⚙️ Workflows

Located under .github/workflows/, 33+ GitHub Actions define CI/CD and reproducibility guardrails:
	•	CI / Tests: linting, unit tests, Hydra config validation, pipeline selftest ￼.
	•	Diagnostics: generate GLL heatmaps, FFT/UMAP/t-SNE, symbolic overlays, HTML dashboards.
	•	Submissions: validate and package Kaggle-ready ZIPs; gated kaggle-submit.yml.
	•	Reproducibility: hash checks, config integrity, DVC pipeline consistency.
	•	Security: CodeQL, Bandit, dependency audits, Trivy scans.
	•	Automation: artifact sweeper, stale issue management, dependabot auto-merge.

➡️ See workflows/README.md and workflows/architecture.md.

⸻

🔐 Security & Disclosure
	•	Vulnerabilities must be filed using security_report.yml (safe/dry-run repro only).
	•	No secrets or payloads should be posted publicly.
	•	See SECURITY.md for disclosure windows and maintainer contacts ￼.

⸻

🧭 Contribution Principles
	•	CLI-First: All changes are validated via spectramind CLI commands ￼.
	•	Hydra-Safe: New params/configs go through structured YAML, not code constants ￼.
	•	DVC-Tracked: Large data/artifacts tracked by DVC, ensuring dataset/model reproducibility.
	•	CI-Verified: No merges without green workflows and pipeline consistency checks.
	•	Docs-Updated: README, configs.md, and CHANGELOG must reflect changes.
