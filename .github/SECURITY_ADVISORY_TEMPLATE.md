# 🔒 SpectraMind V50 — Security Advisory Template

This file serves as the **standard template** for drafting and publishing a security advisory 
within the SpectraMind V50 repository.  
It ensures that all vulnerabilities, mitigations, and reproducibility impacts are captured 
with clarity, reproducibility, and full context.

---

## 📌 Advisory Metadata
- **Advisory ID:** SEC-YYYY-NNN  
- **Date Published:** YYYY-MM-DD  
- **Reported By:** (Name, handle, or “Anonymous Researcher”)  
- **Status:** Draft | Under Review | Published | Resolved  
- **CVE Identifier (if assigned):** CVE-XXXX-YYYY  

---

## 🚨 Vulnerability Summary
Provide a concise description of the issue:
- Affected component(s) (e.g., `spectramind.py`, `calibration_pipeline.py`, Hydra configs, Dockerfile)  
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., code execution, privilege escalation, data leak, model poisoning)  
- Brief impact statement (one-paragraph summary of why it matters)

---

## 🔎 Technical Details
Document precise technical information for reproducibility and validation:
- **Vulnerable Code / Config Section(s):** file paths, line numbers, YAML keys, CLI commands  
- **Root Cause:** Explain *why* the vulnerability exists (design flaw, unsafe default, missing validation, etc.)  
- **Proof of Concept (if applicable):** Provide reproduction steps or CLI invocation showing the issue.  
- **Scope:** Which environments are impacted (local dev, CI, Kaggle runtime, Docker, cloud cluster)?  

---

## 🧭 Affected Versions
- **SpectraMind V50 versions impacted:** (e.g., v50.1.0 through v50.2.3)  
- **Hydra Configs impacted:** (list YAMLs if specific to configs)  
- **Environments affected:** (Ubuntu 24.04 workstation, Kaggle container, CI runner, etc.)  

---

## ⚠️ Severity & Risk Assessment
- **CVSS Score (if available):** e.g., 7.5 (High)  
- **Impact:** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  
- **Likelihood:** (Low / Medium / High)  
- **Exploitability:** (Describe ease of exploitation, prerequisites, and vectors)  
- **Reproducibility Impact:** How this vulnerability may compromise CLI-first reproducibility, Hydra configs, or DVC data integrity.  

---

## 🛠️ Mitigation & Remediation
- **Immediate Workarounds:** CLI flags, config overrides, or environment variables to reduce risk.  
- **Permanent Fix:** Describe code, config, or Dockerfile changes required.  
- **Patched Version(s):** (e.g., v50.2.4 and above)  
- **References to Fix:** Commit hash, PR link, Hydra config diff, Docker rebuild notes.  

---

## 📑 Verification Steps
Step-by-step reproducibility procedure for confirming the fix:
1. Checkout patched commit.  
2. Run `spectramind test --deep`.  
3. Validate no failures in `selftest.py` and no reproducibility drift in `run_hash_summary_v50.json`.  
4. Confirm CI logs pass security scans (`.github/workflows/security.yml`).

## ✅ Advisory Checklist
- [ ] Root cause analyzed  
- [ ] Proof of concept documented  
- [ ] Severity assessed (CVSS + qualitative)  
- [ ] Fix merged and versioned  
- [ ] CI/CD updated (security.yml)  
- [ ] Advisory published with reproducibility notes  

---

✦ **Note:** All advisories must preserve *reproducibility first principles*.  
Patches must be tied to Hydra configs, DVC artifacts, and Git commit hashes.  
Every advisory is itself a reproducible artifact.
