# 🏗️ Architecture — Issue Templates for SpectraMind V50

This document defines the **architecture, design intent, and operational flow** of the issue templates under
`.github/issue_template/` for the **SpectraMind V50** repository. These templates enforce **structured, reproducible, and NASA-grade reporting** across all project activities.

---

## 1. System Goals

* **Consistency** — All issues follow structured formats, ensuring uniform triage.
* **Reproducibility** — Reports must capture CLI commands, Hydra configs, and run hashes.
* **Scientific Traceability** — Issues encode expected vs. actual **scientific/physical system behavior**.
* **Fast Triage** — Maintainers get logs, workflow run links, and config context up front.
* **Security & Reliability** — Sensitive reports route through a minimal, controlled channel with coordinated disclosure.

---

## 2. Template Topology

```plaintext
.github/
└── issue_template/
    ├── bug_report.yml
    ├── feature_request.yml
    ├── documentation_request.yml
    ├── performance_issue.yml
    ├── security_report.yml
    ├── config_update.yml
    ├── task_tracking.yml
    └── README.md
```

Each `.yml` file is a GitHub Issue Form with required fields, dropdowns, and checkboxes, ensuring completeness, reproducibility, and uniformity.

---

## 3. Workflow Integration

### Trigger Path

Contributor → New Issue → Select Template → Fill Required Fields
→ Template captures CLI + config hash → Maintainers triage
→ CI/workflows cross-link issue → Fix merged → Resolution documented

### Cross-links & Dependencies

* **Bug Reports** require:

  * CLI call (e.g. `spectramind …`)
  * Config hash (`run_hash_summary_v50.json`)
  * Logs (`logs/v50_debug_log.md`)
* **Feature Requests** link directly to Hydra configs and CLI feasibility.
* **Performance Issues** must attach metrics (utilization, latency, VRAM).
* **Security Reports** are routed to maintainers under `.github/SECURITY.md` with dry-run repro steps.
* **Config Updates** enforce Hydra-safe, DVC-tracked, and CI-integrated config diffs.
* **Task Tracking** ensures DoR/DoD, subtasks, reproducible CLI repro, and artifact evidence.

## 4. Template Roles

| Template                   | Purpose                                | Critical Fields                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| bug\_report.yml            | Capture pipeline/CLI defects           | Steps to reproduce, CLI, config hash, logs                 |
| feature\_request.yml       | Propose new features (scientific/CLI)  | Motivation, proposed CLI/config solution, impact areas     |
| documentation\_request.yml | Request updates to docs/READMEs        | File/section, missing details, proposed update             |
| performance\_issue.yml     | Diagnose bottlenecks/regressions       | Hardware/env, metrics snapshot, expected vs actual         |
| security\_report.yml       | Disclose vulnerabilities safely        | Report type, environment, evidence, mitigation, disclosure |
| config\_update.yml         | Manage Hydra/DVC/CI configs            | Paths, Hydra blocks, compatibility plan, validation tests  |
| task\_tracking.yml         | Plan and track shippable units of work | Acceptance criteria, subtasks, reproducible CLI, DoR/DoD   |

## 5. Alignment with SpectraMind V50 Principles

* **CLI-First** — Every issue references `spectramind` commands.
* **Hydra-Safe Configs** — No hidden params; YAML-only reproducibility.
* **Integrated Logging** — Required excerpts from `v50_debug_log.md`.
* **Scientific Rigor** — Reports explicitly compare expected vs actual physics-informed outputs.
* **Reproducibility Guardrails** — All issues can be rerun from config + hash.

---

## 6. Maintenance Strategy

* Quarterly review to sync with CLI commands and Hydra configs.
* Version pinning to track template evolution across pipeline releases.
* Security hardening to enforce disclosure rules in `security_report.yml`.
* Expansion for domain-specific templates (e.g., symbolic overlays, dashboard regressions).

---

## 7. Example Bug Report Flow

1. User runs:

   ```bash
   spectramind train --config configs/model/v50.yaml
   ```
2. Training fails. User files Bug Report:

   * Includes CLI call, config hash, `v50_debug_log.md` excerpt.
   * Attaches GitHub Actions run link.
3. Maintainer triages:

   * Confirms reproducibility with config hash.
   * Re-runs via CI pipeline.
   * Fix linked to issue and merged after CI passes.

---

## 8. Summary

The `.github/issue_template/` architecture is the **frontline reproducibility and security guard** for SpectraMind V50.
It transforms free-form GitHub issues into structured, reproducible, **science-grade tickets**.
Each issue becomes a scientific record — CLI, config, logs, metrics — ensuring V50 evolves with **traceability, rigor, and mission-grade discipline**.
