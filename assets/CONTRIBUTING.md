## üåü Philosophy

SpectraMind V50 is engineered for **NASA-grade reproducibility**, **neuro-symbolic scientific rigor**, and **CLI-first usability**.  
All contributions must align with these principles:

- **Reproducibility First** ‚Üí every result must be re-runnable (Hydra configs, DVC data hashes, Docker/Poetry environments).  
- **Documentation-First** ‚Üí code without docstrings or diagnostics is incomplete.  
- **Scientific Integrity** ‚Üí no hacks; physics-informed modeling and symbolic constraints must be respected.  
- **Automation Everywhere** ‚Üí every workflow reachable via CLI, CI, and diagnostics dashboards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Fork & Branch
- Fork this repo and create feature branches from `main`.
- Use naming convention:  
  - `feat/<feature>` (new functionality)  
  - `fix/<issue>` (bug fix)  
  - `docs/<section>` (documentation)  
  - `exp/<experiment>` (exploratory trial, subject to cleanup)  

### 2. Environment Setup
- Use **Poetry** for dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry install

	‚Ä¢	Use DVC + lakeFS for dataset synchronization:

dvc pull


	‚Ä¢	Use Docker or Ubuntu setup guide for system parity.

3. Coding Standards
	‚Ä¢	Python ‚â•3.10 required.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce style via pre-commit hooks:

pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files


	‚Ä¢	Linting & formatting stack:
	‚Ä¢	ruff (static analysis + autofix)
	‚Ä¢	black (formatting)
	‚Ä¢	isort (imports, black profile)
	‚Ä¢	mypy (type checking)
	‚Ä¢	Docstrings: All public functions/classes must use Google or NumPy style docstrings with explicit typing.
	‚Ä¢	Logging: Use logging with Rich formatting. Never print().

4. Config Standards
	‚Ä¢	All parameters must live in Hydra YAML configs (configs/).
	‚Ä¢	Never hardcode constants in code ‚Äî use Hydra defaults & overrides.
	‚Ä¢	Use group syntax (model/, data/, training/, diagnostics/).
	‚Ä¢	Document every new config with inline comments.

‚úÖ Pre-Submission Checklist

Before opening a PR, run:

make selftest     # Runs spectramind test --deep
make lint         # Runs ruff, black, isort, mypy
make diagnostics  # Generates small dashboard slice

Confirm that:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ All CLI commands (spectramind <subcommand>) run without error
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Hydra configs resolve with no missing defaults
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ DVC stages (dvc repro) succeed on toy splits
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ v50_debug_log.md captures your CLI calls
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Unit tests (pytest) all pass

‚∏ª

üî¨ Scientific Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Physics-informed models: All modeling must respect physical realism (no negative flux, spectra smoothness).
	‚Ä¢	Symbolic constraints: All training/evaluation must log symbolic losses and violations.
	‚Ä¢	Uncertainty: If your code outputs Œº spectra, you must also implement œÉ calibration (temperature scaling, COREL, or conformal).
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostics: Every new module must integrate with at least one diagnostic visualization (FFT, SHAP, symbolic overlay, etc.).

‚∏ª

üì¶ Submissions & CI

CI/CD is enforced via GitHub Actions:
	‚Ä¢	Linting (lint.yml)
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostics smoke tests (diagnostics.yml)
	‚Ä¢	Submission packaging (kaggle-submit.yml)
	‚Ä¢	End-to-End nightly run (nightly-e2e.yml)

Your branch will not merge unless CI passes.
Use make ci-smoke locally to preview.

‚∏ª

üß™ Testing
	‚Ä¢	Add unit tests under tests/ for every new function or bugfix.
	‚Ä¢	Use pytest and ensure coverage is ‚â•90% for scientific modules.
	‚Ä¢	New CLI subcommands must include:
	‚Ä¢	--help coverage test
	‚Ä¢	--dry-run test
	‚Ä¢	CLI log entry in v50_debug_log.md

‚∏ª

üìñ Documentation
	‚Ä¢	Update README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md if your change alters project structure.
	‚Ä¢	Add diagrams (Mermaid or Graphviz) to assets/diagrams/ if relevant.
	‚Ä¢	Any scientific upgrade should be reflected in the PDF knowledge docs (AI Design, Modeling, Radiation, Lensing, etc.).

‚∏ª

üìù Commit Conventions

Follow Conventional Commits:

feat(train): add gradient accumulation and resume support
fix(corel): correct œÉ coverage plot normalization
docs(gui): expand dashboard section with t-SNE integration

	‚Ä¢	Prefix: feat, fix, docs, test, ci, refactor, chore.
	‚Ä¢	Scope: folder or subsystem (train, corel, cli, gui, data, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Subject: short imperative sentence.

‚∏ª

üéØ Pull Requests
	‚Ä¢	Fill out the PR template.
	‚Ä¢	Reference related issues (Fixes #123).
	‚Ä¢	Include screenshots/plots if adding diagnostics.
	‚Ä¢	Keep PRs small and focused. Large changes must be split.

‚∏ª

üåç Community Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Be respectful and constructive in reviews.
	‚Ä¢	Share scientific reasoning for changes (include equations or citations if applicable).
	‚Ä¢	Kaggle discussions & community notebooks may be linked in PRs for context.
