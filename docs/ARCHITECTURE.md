ðŸŒŒ SpectraMind V50 â€” System Architecture

Neuro-symbolic, physics-informed AI pipeline for the NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge

â¸»

0. Purpose & Scope

SpectraMind V50 is a neuro-symbolic, physics-informed system engineered for ESAâ€™s Ariel exoplanet mission data.
It processes telescope observations (FGS1, AIRS) into reconstructed spectra (Î¼ Â± Ïƒ) while enforcing scientific rigor, reproducibility, and CI/CD safety.
	â€¢	Git + Hydra â†’ reproducible logic & configs
	â€¢	DVC â†’ reproducible data & models
	â€¢	Typer CLI â†’ reproducible execution

ðŸ”— For data subsystem internals, see .dvc/architecture.md.

1. High-Level Layout

SpectraMind V50/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                # Core pipeline code
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/            # Hydra YAML configs (training, model, diagnostics, submission)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Raw + processed telescope data (tracked via DVC)
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/            # Model predictions, diagnostics (tracked via DVC)
â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # Trained models (DVC)
â”œâ”€â”€ artifacts/          # Submission bundles, exports (DVC)
â”œâ”€â”€ .dvc/               # DVC control system (see .dvc/architecture.md)
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/            # CI/CD workflows (lint, CI, submission, security)
â””â”€â”€ docs/               # System documentation (this file, subsystem guides)

	â€¢	Code â†’ deterministic logic (Git)
	â€¢	Configs â†’ structured Hydra composition (YAMLs)
	â€¢	Data & Models â†’ binary artifacts (DVC-managed)

2. Pipeline Stages

The system is defined as a DVC DAG (dvc.yaml) and orchestrated via the unified CLI:
	1.	Calibration
spectramind calibrate â†’ raw FGS1/AIRS â†’ calibrated data
	â€¢	DVC stage: calibrate
	â€¢	Hydra config: configs/data/calibration.yaml
	2.	Training
spectramind train â†’ train FGS1+GNN model
	â€¢	DVC stage: train
	â€¢	Hydra config: configs/training/config_v50.yaml
	3.	Prediction
spectramind predict â†’ Î¼, Ïƒ spectra predictions
	â€¢	DVC stage: predict
	â€¢	Hydra config: configs/inference/predict_v50.yaml
	4.	Diagnostics
spectramind diagnose dashboard â†’ GLL, FFT, SHAP, symbolic overlays
	â€¢	DVC stage: diagnose
	â€¢	Hydra config: configs/diagnostics/diagnose_v50.yaml
	5.	Submission
spectramind submit â†’ Kaggle-ready bundle
	â€¢	DVC stage: submit
	â€¢	Hydra config: configs/submission/submit_v50.yaml

ðŸ”— See .dvc/architecture.md for how these stages are stored and versioned in DVC.

3. Integration of Subsystems
	â€¢	Hydra Config-as-Code
Structured YAML configs define all parameters, overridable at CLI runtime.
	â€¢	Typer CLI
One entrypoint: spectramind
	â€¢	Subcommands: calibrate, train, predict, diagnose, submit
	â€¢	Auto-generated --help, tab completion, reproducibility logging
	â€¢	DVC Data Backbone
	â€¢	Tracks all artifacts in data/, models/, outputs/, artifacts/
	â€¢	Provides git checkout && dvc checkout reproducibility
	â€¢	Remote sync (S3, GCS, Azure, local) ensures team-wide consistency
ðŸ”— Detailed in .dvc/architecture.md.
	â€¢	CI/CD Guardrails
	â€¢	GitHub Actions validate Hydra configs + DVC stages
	â€¢	Pre-flight: dvc status + selftest
	â€¢	Fail fast if pointers/configs drift

4. Diagnostics & Explainability

Diagnostics run via CLI (spectramind diagnose) and are exported as both static plots and interactive HTML dashboards.
	â€¢	DVC Plots (.dvc/plots/) define JSON templates for:
	â€¢	Training loss
	â€¢	Calibration reliability & coverage
	â€¢	FFT power spectrum
	â€¢	Symbolic rule violations
	â€¢	Dashboard Export
	â€¢	SHAP overlays
	â€¢	Symbolic logic graphs
	â€¢	FFT autocorr, entropy maps
	â€¢	Full run log trace (v50_debug_log.md)

â¸»

5. Best Practices
	â€¢	Always run pipeline stages via CLI (spectramind ...), never ad-hoc scripts
	â€¢	Hydra overrides, not hardcoding, for dataset/model switching
	â€¢	Run dvc push after every successful run â†’ sync with team/CI remote
	â€¢	CI requires dvc status clean before merging PRs
	â€¢	Never commit blobs in .dvc/cache/

â¸»

6. Mission-Grade Acceptance Criteria

SpectraMind V50 is production-ready when:
	â€¢	Any past run is restorable via git checkout && dvc checkout
	â€¢	All stages are represented in dvc.yaml
	â€¢	CI/CD enforces consistency (Hydra + DVC checks pass)
	â€¢	All diagnostics integrate into HTML dashboard & DVC plots
	â€¢	Kaggle bundles are byte-identical across environments
