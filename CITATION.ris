AB  - SpectraMind V50 is a mission-grade, CLI-first, neuro-symbolic, physics-informed AI pipeline for the NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge. It integrates a long-sequence Structured State-Space Model (SSM) for time-series (FGS1) with a molecule- and wavelength-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) for AIRS spectra, trained with Gaussian log-likelihood plus symbolic/physics constraints. The system emphasizes NASA-grade reproducibility through Hydra configs, DVC/lakeFS data versioning, CI workflows, Docker/Poetry environments, and deterministic self-tests. Outputs include per-wavelength μ and σ with diagnostics (UMAP/t-SNE, SHAP, symbolic overlays, FFT, calibration maps) and leaderboard-ready Kaggle submissions. All functionality is orchestrated through a unified Typer CLI with integrated logging, symbolic validation, and diagnostics dashboards.
